= GCloud Emulators for Docker

This repository is a workaround for https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sdk-docker/issues/202[this issue]. The idea is to build custom images in order to run emulators such as `datasore`, `firestore` and `pubsub` based on the alpine image.

NOTE: `spanner` is already provided as a docker image https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/cloud-spanner-emulator/GLOBAL/emulator[here].
